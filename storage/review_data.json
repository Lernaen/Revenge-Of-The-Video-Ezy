      "review_text": "Post-Apocalyptic or Australia? The independent, Ozploitation film that would lay the framework for arguably the most influential post-apocalyptic film franchise of all time. It serves as the prime case study film for making an action movie on a bare-bones budget. The “post” in post-apocalyptic might be a bit of a stretch for this film with plot points and settings that feel out of place for the rest of the series, partly due to budget constraints. However, it delivers on the two most important aspects of Mad Max movies: boundary-pushing costume design (for people and cars) as well as adrenaline-pumping, automobile action scenes.",

    "review_text": "Classic war film that ranks as one of the best ever produced, thanks to a top notch cast and direction that doesn't shy away from the harsher side of war. The actors are a who's who of stars, from Gregory Peck to David Niven to Anthony Quinn, all who shine in their roles and could have easily been the leads by themselves but actually make an epic ensemble. Behind the camera, director J. Lee Thompson crafts a first rate adventure epic, with plenty of brilliant action set pieces and exotic locations. However, what puts the movie really over is its willingness to show the darker side of war, from cold-blooded killings to using an injured colleague to further the mission. It's not preachy and one could argue the actions were necessary but the film doesn't glamorize war either. All in all, a first rate adventure film like no other.",
